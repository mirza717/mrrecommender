These systems predict the most likely product that the users are most likely to purchase and are of interest to. Companies like Netflix, Amazon, etc. use recommender systems to help their users to identify the correct product or movies for them.</p>"

Furthermore, the embeddings can be learned automatically, without relying on hand-engineering of features.</p>"
